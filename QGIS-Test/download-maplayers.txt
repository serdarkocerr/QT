The basemap data can be found by clicking on the Raster link. We'll want the highest-resolution data available, so use the link in the Large scale data, 1:10m section.
While you could use any of these datasets as a basemap, we will download the Natural Earth I with Shaded Relief, Water, and Drainages dataset. Make sure you download the high-resolution version of this dataset so that the raster image will still look good when the user has zoomed in.

For the landmarks, we'll be using the "populated places" dataset. Go back to the main downloads page and click on the Cultural link in the Large scale data, 1:10m section. Scroll down to the Populated Places section and click on the Download Populated Places link.

Once you have finished downloading, you should have two ZIP archives on your computer:

NE1_HR_LC_SR_W_DR.zip

ne_10m_populated_places.zip

Create a folder named data, decompress the preceding two ZIP archives, and place the resulting directories into your data folder.
